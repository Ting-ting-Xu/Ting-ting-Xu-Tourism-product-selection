10,Great value for money - close to Paddington Station,Great location. Clean and modern with great touches such as underfloor heating.,Bed was a bit small.,Australia,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,July 2022,19 August 2022,,
8.0,Weighing up the positives and negatives this is a charming boutique hotel. I would stay here again.,Very friendly and helpful staff. The cleaning staff were also very good. My room was always tidied and spotless during my 1 week stay. The rooms look small but the design is very clever with lots of storage spaces under the bed. I liked the wellness theme of the hotel. It feels like a calm and serene place to be.,The building is small and not completely soundproof between the rooms. The gym is a Peloton bike and a small selection of free weights. Due to the size of the space guests have to book a spot to use the gym or infrared sauna and I had to get someone at Reception to let me into the gym room. I ended up paying to use a more equipped gym outside the hotel. The dining area is outsourced and it felt at times that the cafe owners weren't fully in-sync with the hotel team. The level of service isn't as high as the hotel's.,Australia,Deluxe Double Room,7 nights ·,Group,October 2022,26 October 2022,,

9.2,Stylish and sustainable,"The key things that struck me about this property was their commitment to sustainability and the attention to design.There are a number of initiatives around the hotel to help minimise wasteful use of plastic and introduce sustainable habits. These include things like refillable water fountain in the hallway, dispensers in bathroom. Clever and forward thinking and made me appreciate the place more.By the nature of the building, some rooms have limited space. That was the case for my room, but it was designed in a way to make the most of the space available, with smart space saving initiatives, that also looked stylish. It felt newly fitted and modern.","Whilst accepting the shape of the building means some rooms will be small, I did find myself banging my knees and elbows navigating about the room and bathroom.

8.0,Lovely hotel for a great value in a perfect location. Highly recommend!,"This was a great hotel for a great value! Location was perfect for us because we wanted to stay near Paddington and have easy access to tons of tube lines as well as the Heathrow express to the airport for an early morning flight.

It’s located on a lovely street that is a pleasant 8-10 min walk to the train station.","We had a really hard time getting our air conditioning to stay on consistently overnight. I think most of the year that wouldn’t really matter, we just happened to be staying during a week when it was warm and I have a hard time sleeping when I’m too hot. We usually just solved it by cracking a window open and let in lovely fresh air, so it wasn’t a huge deal.

Staff were very friendly at reception and in the restaurant.  The menu was very nice and varied for breakfast.","I only had a small overnight bag, but a suitcase would have been difficult in the room and also up and down a few stairs to my room.

There was no chance of me doing some zoom calls or anything in that room. Unfortunately my room was located next to one of the doors in the hallway so it was quite noisy when people were leaving their rooms etc. Next time I'd pay the additional fee for an upgrade to a better/bigger room.

We did not include breakfast in our reservation, but only once took it in the hotel and it was ok. Staff was always nice and attentive to our needs.","Although the rooms are comfortable and have all the necessary, the room assigned to us was too small for two people. Unfortunately there was no possibility of a change as the hotel was full at the moment, so we could manage. However, number of people should be taken into consideration when assigning the rooms. Also, more hangers for towels should be nice in the bathroom. But non of these are deal breakers.",Mexico,Deluxe Double Room,7 nights ·,Couple,July 2022,1 August 2022,1,

The location of the hotel was perfect but we chose it for that reason.  Partner was due to go into St. Mary's Hospital for an operation and we booked the hotel so we did not face any travel disruptions and had a relaxing night the day before the operation.  Breakfast was the worse part of our stay.  The venue was very pleasant but the service was appalling.  We had a deadline to be at the hospital, which is 5 minutes away, and the time we had to wait for our cereal choice caused my partner serious stress.  We did complain, and paid no service.

Great food in the restaurant.  Cool to have an infrared sauna (but see below).  The library is lovely to chill and work. Great location - quiet and central in Paddington so les than 10 mins walk from Heathrow Express/Elizabeth Line.,"Great idea but lot’s of attention to detail missing and execution that makes them not 4 starts.  The medication pod ipod did not work properly. there is only coffee/kettle downstairs and no alternative milk offered (I mean we are booking into a vegan restaurant hotel - the excuse is it is outsourced.  The website speaks of a sleep box but front desk don’t know/it costs 50gbp, the aromatherapy was not put in the room despite asking. the infrared sauna is great but they make you walk into the lobby to get them to open it (instructions in the sauna say heat it up for 10 mins before entering and they don’t allow for this), only one person in the gym allowed but many can be next to each other for yoga, bedside lamp and USB not working), no longer REN in the bathroom and meditation channel did not work properly on the TV either.

9.0,A peaceful boutique retreat in a very convenient location.,The decor is great with lots of thoughtful touches throughout. Lovely comfy mattress. I enjoy the mindfulness approach and the overall feel is very different from the usual hotels we stay in. The downstairs areas and wall hangings are lovely.  We enjoyed reading the welcome folder and took a breakfast recommendation from the list given.We didn't get the opportunity to use the recreational areas as we only stayed one night but they looked very inviting. I did sit in the meditation pod briefly and would have liked to stay longer. The toiletries smell divine! And the shower was perfect. Our room was cozy and welcoming with ample storage for luggage. Very friendly service.,"This list is only if we were being very pernickety. From having worked in hotels, often you won't know something can be improved unless a guest mentions it. So it's with that in mind that I mention the following. Our stay was truly excellent. Couldn't find check out time or a menu and prices for breakfast in the welcome folder. Hot drinks in the room would have been lovely. We did get a drink from downstairs on our way up to bed. I was surprised that they were in polystyrene cups. I'm guessing by the fact the lids didn't fit that they had run out and that's all the local shop had. Reusable ceramic mugs would be a better option. Tiny detail that amused my partner, Is one the pictures in our room didn't fit the frame properly. I know it's not important, but it does spoil the illusion of luxury a little. My partner did watch the meditation channel for a bit and found the narrator could have been better.. She made mistakes as if it was done in one take and unedited. Couldn't find any signage directly outside the lift and had to ask a helpful cleaner to point us to our room.Lastly, the room was quite loud. Single glazing Windows let in noise and a draft from outside (Though past midnight the road wasn't busy at all). I could hear another room's phone call from the bathroom and woke in the morning when a neighbour tried to lock their room. Oh and you might be haunted! The shower started on it's own at 1:15am. About an hour after I'd finished in the bathroom and there was a loud thud in the night also. But that could have been someone falling out of bed above us?! These are all very minor things though and we really enjoyed our stay. Would recommend.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,March 2022,8 March 2022,1,

The breakfast room was lovely but unfortunately we’d not realised that it was vegan/plant -focussed. Coffee was OK but cups rather small and expensive (style before practicality..). The main grumble was that we thought that the granola was really unacceptably priced for what was an exceptionally small quantity. It was literally a small tub of coconut based yoghurt in a bowl with barely a sprinkle of granola on top plus a few chunks of fruit. Very nicely arranged but arguably perhaps £5 worth rather than the £10 charged. Eggs on sourdough was a better bet at £7. While we appreciate there was an aim to be plant based and ethical, it didn’t represent good value and was a bit of a disappointment really. One of those times when you say ‘oh….’ when the plate arrives. I’m all for ethical food but not when it’s an excuse for over-pricing just because you’ve given a bowl of yoghurt and a few bits of fruit a trendy ‘well-being’ styled name! We spent £28 on breakfast for two and left hungry, which I guess says it all really.We’d stay again but probably wouldn’t have breakfast as it kind of let the rest of the hotel down sadly. Most folk want a decent, fairly priced breakfast- as they say ‘breakfast like a king’.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,January 2022,5 February 2022,1,

The shower pressure was fantastic, and the reception staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Our tiny complaint did not affect our stay, and we would absolutely visit again without hesitation.","The one complaint we would have, is that the towels did have a slightly old smell to them which didn’t make them feel completely clean, and there were a few hairs on the floor which ended up on the bed (as they had stuck to our socks).",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,June 2021,30 June 2021,,

As they are eco-friendly they were trying to conserve on power, so had to phone down to reception each night to get them to turn it on. Would turn off as soon as room had cooled to temp. So would then get hot again. Also doesn’t really make sense when the aircon stays on continuously during the day with no issues.No tea/coffee making facilities in the room and the desk working space was tiny with an uncomfortable chair for long periods of time.

I haven't got the names of all staff members, but special thanks to Ioana and Angelo for their willingness to help and professionalism.* The Hotel is in a nice area, close to public transport links* The interior on the hotel is actually much much nicer than in the photos. Really modern and nicely structured, we can only recommend it. There is a really nice and quiet library, but also several hang-out areas.* The rooms and towels were pristine and all staff members were respecting the current social distancing and covid rules at all times.* We've arrived early to the hotel, in fact 5 hours earlier than our normal check-in time, and we asked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel until we can check in. They went the extra mile and checked us in instead, which was a very nice gesture from their part.* Since we had our train late at night, we've asked at the check-out, whether we could leave our luggage at the hotel and pick it up later. Although, they do not have a luggage storage area, they still agreed to store our luggage even after checkout, which again was a really nice gesture from the staff.","* The only inconvenience throughout our whole stay was a weird humming noise that we noticed in the hotel room. We weren't sure where it came from, but were suspecting that it was due to the ventilation system from the bathroom (it usually took between 5 to 10 minutes for the noise to go away). Overall, a very insignificant inconvenience I'd say, rather than an actual problem.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,May 2021,2 June 2021,,

The library is so relaxing, I almost fell asleep on the chair with the goat skin throw. The sauna suite is incredible....a private space with ensuite shower....Luther Vandross serenaded me on my ipod....☺️ and the restaurant food is delicious as well as being wholesome, thank you Fernando my amazing waiter....The sourdough toast, scrambled eggs, vegan sausage and spinach for breakfast was amazing....The rooms are simply furnished and well appointed. Clean, smell delightful and the beds are crisp and comfortable.The green, grey and white hues of the hotel decor make you feel rested and comfortable as soon as you enter the hotel. I didn't use the gym or onsite massage, but they're available. The latter at a cost.I have already booked another stay for next month! The location is just off the Edgeware road, which is bustling with shops, market stall on church street, restaurants and supermarkets.The Casa Spa, nearby (just off the Edgeware road), made me feel re-born, with an authentic hamman steam/scrub/massage treatment.This hotel is now my home to home.

Honestly, in the morning, we just wanted a coffee and a croissant, be it vegan, and this was not available. The owners should keep in mind that travelers don't always come from countries where breakfast is a large meal. Keep it simple please.

Also as our window was towards the road but underground level we got all the noise tourists dragging their luggages (the whole block is basically hotels). The room was otherwise comfortable and nice but really small for us traveling from long distance and having big suitcase, it basically took all the floor space of the room.

Even though the room didn't have any traffic noise as it was located at the back of the property, anyone working in the corridor, entering adjacent rooms or even moving around too much on the floor above could be heard.

Our room would have been great for a solo traveler but I wouldn't recommend it for two people. In addition, a shrill alarm ripped us out of sleep in the morning (once around 6 o clock) on two occasions. I have no idea why this happened and if sb in the hotel just pressed the wrong button on accident but I can't recommend this place on account of not feeling well rested even once - which is a shame since rest and relaxation seem to be on of their major selling points.The breakfast at the in house restaurant was ok but nothing to write home about.

I’ve burnt myself several times. I’ve complained at the reception and I was told that it’s fixed only to burn myself AGAIN! Some people at the front desk are very nice while a couple are rude. There was a man who was making an odd and uncomfortable face while I was enquiring. He seemed pretty judgemental even before listening to me completely! I was assigned a basement room and when I asked why, I was told that that’s because I’m checking in late. Am I being punished? Thankfully the other staff member checked for availability and gave a room in the upper floor. Why would you assign a basement room to someone when you have other rooms available? it’s not like I’m being charged any less. There are two AC controls and one of them has overriding temperature controls at the front desk. I had to call every night requesting to adjust the temperature!

The noise from the floors above is very loud, it's as if your head is getting stepped on at night. If you stay here definitely stay on the top floor. I stayed in two different rooms so this wasn't a one-off experience. It's too bad since this is such an awesome property. I suggest the owner put carpets down on the floors or do something to fix this issue. I know I'm not the only one who has had this problem. I had three nights booked but only stayed for two.

Complained about our initial room and the staff couldn’t do more to move us.The second room was great as it was in the basement and had a sky light which was novel.","Our first room was a nightmare. It was very small for two people but more importantly you could hear every footstep from the floor above. The pipes went round the back so any time the room above flushed or turned on the taps you would hear the pipes.

We asked if the door to it would be shut at night and the receptionist said it would so when we got back at 11pm to the generator door open and a constant droaning through our room we were far from impressed. It wasn’t until 3 phone calls later (the night receptionist had no idea what to tell us) that we were given a new room at around midnight. When asked about our stay the next morning the receptionists didn’t seem overly fussed about our experience!!When you add this to the 45 minute wait for our room on arrival, the shower that was either steaming hot or freezing cold and the lack of items in the room that are stated as included on their website - a generally disappointing stay!",United Kingdom,Deluxe Twin Room,1 night ·,Family,July 2022,29 July 2022,,

One chair only so forget two of you spending any time in the room unless one of you is in bed. Breakfast: nice sunny room but mostly stools so you can’t relax properly and lean back. A big wait for breakfast with lots of people complaining about the wait (“how long does it take to make eggs”) but the worst thing was that when the breakfast came, it was pretty disgusting. Almost solid scrambled eggs on soggy toast and they managed to make avocado smash taste awful. Nice squeezed orange juice though.

4.0,'Style' over substance.,"A nice location, and a pleasant enough room - once they finally gave us one with a window ...","The urban wellness ‘vibe’ here doesn’t really ring true. On checking in, our wellness levels plummeted immediately when we were asked for a £20 per night damage deposit. That might be ok for a cheap ‘party central’ hotel on a Saturday night in a provincial city, but not for one in this location and at this price level. So not a welcoming start, and actually quite insulting. We refused to pay it. The room we were allocated didn't have any windows(!!) so we had to ask for a different room - thankfully one with a window was available, but windowless rooms are surely not good for anyone's 'wellness', unless you enjoy sensory deprivation. Wellness also not helped by a lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This was available in the reception (no choice of milk though - cow, plant-based or otherwise - so much for wellness again) but having to carry hot liquids back to the room up the narrow stairs/through fire doors was not fun. On Sunday morning, there were no tea bags left so we asked if they could get some from the ‘Kitchen’, but we were told that wasn’t possible because the 'Kitchen' is outsourced and not part of the hotel itself! Thankfully, we didn't bother with the granola breakfasts at £15 a pop - although we might have got some tea in a proper cup out of it. The room itself was fairly comfortable, but the space was cramped. Overall, the 'carefully curated wellness vibe' was just performative really - the room had a little box (handcrafted ‘recycled’ wood of course!) to help you to put away/escape from your smartphone, yet it also had the usual massive wall-mounted TV (off-centre from the bed!) like any other hotel … except other hotels have kettles in their rooms!",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,February 2022,7 February 2022,1,

The window available you could not see through and in order to look at anything you need to open it. The window opened to about a thumb length. Even if you don't mind that, the window looked into the hotel's ""gym"" area  and because the gym area has lights always on, I could not sleep without completely closing the curtains. Essentially there is no window as there is no view and doesn't even help for extra ventilation (noise/smell from gym area). It was there to mislead potential customers. (windowless rooms cost less in other accommodations).There will be a deposit charge when you get there, this is not clear at the start.We had an apartment at the lower floor(basement), there was a real sewage smell in the corridors, but not so much in the room.The bathroom is very small so if you are by any way bigger size you will have difficulty showering. (I am 180cm/85kg and could barely turn around in the shower.There is nowhere to hang a 2nd towel/face towel so I had to hang them outside the shower where the coat hangers are(no other place to hang them).",Cyprus,King Room,4 nights ·,Couple,February 2022,4 February 2022,,

First days I felt like I am in lost hotel. Extremely narrow corridors, to get to my room I could only use lift (didn't like it,covid times i prefer walk by stairs if) lost my way to get to my room by stairs many times, then I had to use only lift. Pre-booked sauna, no staff told me I have only like 30 min or so (sauna didn't heat up in time) then cleaner was banging on the door - get out! I have to clean it, I have others coming to use it. Wow! Ok, nice. Breakfast menu - very expensive very poor choices. I certainly would not stay again, for price I paid. I'm sorry.Checking out - I said to that guy for deposit you took at checking in - take the food bill out and pay me back the rest. Yet, he was like okay just give the card you paid deposit, then he still took bill for the food and no refund.. called later couple of days asking where is my refund- oh you need to wait 10 days until you will get it.

1.0,WARNING! Serious fire safety breach - consider anywhere else,"Room was clean, hotel is in a good location and in visibly good condition. Staff were friendly when asking questions. WiFi was actually the best I have had in a hotel.","Staying for 6 nights - allocated a room on the lower ground floor with no window.Shower was at best hit and miss, even though it was thermostatic it swung widly from hot to cold.However, the primary issue is around fire safety and for this reason I would never book this hotel again, I have contacted Booking.com customer services to investigate, London Fire Brigade and Westminster Council. I would not book this hotel again and I would suggest you do not also because this breach is serious and could have been catastrophic:I was staying in room LG18 on the lower ground floor. The fire alarm went off around 6am on Tuesday 07/09/2021 - I immediately evacuated.1) The fire door directed to by signage was blocked by a box with bottles. Fortunately the power was on or I would not have seen this if trying to evacuate if power is off.2) The fire escape led into a small below pavement level exit area, there was a bolt with ""break glass"" and hammer to exit the area. However, the glass had been replaced by a metal tube and whilst I tried to hit it with the provided hammer assuming it would break it did not. I was essentially trapped in this area close to the building; if it were a genuine fire then would have been at risk.3) It then appeared others were being let back into the building. I could not exit that area. No one came to check if anyone was there.

Despite being told prior to arrival that we could leave luggage after check out and collect later in the day the reception staff didn’t allow this saying there was not any facilities. I’ve stayed many times in London and on every occasion other hotels have provided this facility. We therefore had to take our luggage with us and pay to leave it at the museums we visited. Some of the shops we visited such as Harrods wanted £25 per piece of luggage to store.

It was ~$200 for a 100 sq ft room that had no window to the outside (it was facing the interiors and would not open, which I think is definitely a fire hazard and made the room incredibly stuffy) and was on the floor of the “lobby” where you could hear every person that passed through the first floor, making sleep impossible. The bathroom was so small that you’d knees hit the sink when sitting on the toilet, I live in NYC and have never had this cramped of a space in all 5 apartments I’ve lived in, and I paid for one of the better rooms (double deluxe).The staff seemed very disorganized and the vibe of the entire check-in process/area was just very… off.

2.0,Never staying in this hotel,it was clean,"I have stayed at more than 15 hotels in London but this one was the most over priced for the size of the hotel room, equipments in the hotel, and their staffs’ service.

Because I was attending an award show and needed to get ready with a mirror where a plug in is close to, I asked if the hotel has any mirror or at least an extension cord, they just said no without checking, totally not accommodating. there are stairs in the room and the hallway, if you have a big luggage (which was my case) it’s quite a hassle. they are marketing the hotel as a hotel to relax and enjoy spa experiences, but you have to book the gym and the sauna in advance and both can accommodate only one person at a time. they also don’t have slippers because they are “not sustainable”.

That was about it.,"My partner wasn't allowed to check in as he didn't have the card we'd used to secure the booking. This meant that although he'd arrived at the property at 4pm, he wasn't allowed access to the room until I arrived shortly before 7pm, bringing the card with me. Even though the hotel had taken one nights stay from my card, the hotel staff said they needed to see the card in person before giving us access to the room. He'd been on night shifts and so was wanting to take a nap before we went out for an evening meal, and so therefore had to sleep on the sofa in the library. In all my stays in countless hotels around the world, I've never known the hotel to refuse a check in until they'd seen with their own eyes the card that was used on the booking - WHEN THEY'D ALREADY TAKEN 50% OF THE COST OF THE BOOKING. The staff were rude and unapologetic. We'd emailed the hotel before we'd arrived to say that we were celebrating our engagement, and had saved up for the trip. One of the reasons given to my fiancee that he couldn't have access to the room before I arrived was because it would ""spoil the surprise."" By this comment, we'd been led to believe the hotel had arranged something special for our stay. But there wasn't anything in the room that denoted a social occasion. Which we found a little strange considering the comments... We didn't sleep very well -  there isn't any double glazing so the room is incredibly noisy. Yes this is supposed to be a mindfulness hotel but I think the staff should be given a lesson in how to treat people with kindness... their tone was frequently sharp, impolite and rude. The infrared sauna is a bit of a show-sauna. I'd booked it for 7am and when I arrived the sauna had been off all night.

The paper bags in bins, rather than the usual plastic were also brilliant. The kettle at reception was essential and well used by us, as kettles aren't provided in the rooms. The 'Happiness' breakfast was delicious but please label what's vegan (as above). Staff were mostly lovely. Room style was Skandi cool, as was the rest of the hotel. Location great for Paddington, which helped us for getting home. Even though not the  most exciting part of town it's quieter and more reasonably priced than the West End or other fancier parts. Nicer than staying in a large chain hotel and much cheaper (for now). Had a very European vibe which is so much better than a sad, Brexit Britain one )-:","The room was very small and there was nowhere to sit, except on the bed and one tiny hard stool. 5 coat hangers and no pegs meant not enough room for clothes, wet coats (we had torrential rain whilst we were there), or for wet towels once used as the bathroom rail was tiny.I was expecting an upgrade (if available) as per booking.com terms, but this wasn't discussed at check in.No-one asked me on check out whether I'd had a nice stay.Items at breakfast not labelled vegan, and the waiter didn't understand me when we spoke, as English wasn't his first language, so it was difficult to communicate about ingredients.

Rooms are very small, with low ceilings and no windows. It has been noisy since 6am.  I don't discuss it when has a yoga class. The teacher shouts as if there is no one else in the hotel, with music. Our stay for 2 nights out of 3 was unacceptable. We asked for a change of room and we were taken to the second floor, where they were completely different.  Normal room size and quiet.Lastly, when we arrived we were asked for a £ 60 deposit, which is nowhere to be mentioned and there is no real reason, room not having a minibar and is fully payed at check-in.Finally, while Booking had  another price, there I was asked for another amount which I mentioned and solved.",Greece,,3 nights ·,Couple,February 2020,22 February 2020,,

4.0,"Dirty Room, Noisy Construction, moved the room twice and got a poor refund",Concept of the House is nice.,"Dirty Room, Management. 2 night stay in early feb 2020. Arrived late. Sorry to say: My 1st Room had 3 big bunchs of black Hair on the Floor and I had to clean it myself at arrival. I then recognized in the night that the construction stuff outside were loose and very loud in the wind and I could not sleep. I then changed the room in the middle of the night into one that figured out to have the same noise problem. In the morning then I had to postpone my appointment because I was so tired of this terrible night. At 11 (my half day was already gone) I got my 3rd room and asked friendly for a refund of this 1st night. I had endless time consuming discussions with the reception guy who seems to have to discuss every little refund with ""a manager"" somewhere in the orbit. Bottomline: I only got a 30 bucks discount for myself cleaning up the 1st room, moving twice and loosing a complete night of sleep and half a day of appointments because of the poor management. Overall a nice place, but this really would annoy anybody and I hope the ""management"" will read this and act in a different way to other people visiting their place.",Germany,,2 nights ·,Solo traveller,February 2020,2 March 2020,,
