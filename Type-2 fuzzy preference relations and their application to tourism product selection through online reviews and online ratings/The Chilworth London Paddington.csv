I loved being able to open the blinds and watch the street. I did not use the dining area and opted for room service as it was quite busy. Shoair and Lucas were so helpful during my stay. I informed Shear that I had a train departing from Paddington at 07.48 and he promptly woke me at 07. It is a _very_ close walk to Paddington to keep in mind the sidewalks, roads, and cobblestones can be a pain to manuever through. I was unsure if onsite parking was available but I felt safe and comfortable. The mini fridge is a great touch if you picked up a few lagers before checking in.","Ice. The room heats fast so you turn it town and open a window and then it cools too fast. An ice machine would have made my cocktails better.

It came quickly and was delicious, and a good value.  I also really like how close the hotel is to Paddington.  It is so easy to take the Heathrow Express to Paddington and then walk 5-10 minutes to the hotel through a neighborhood that feels very safe.","I like to have a quiet room, especially because I stay at this hotel because it is close to Paddington/Heathrow Express and I normally have to get up around 5:30 to catch my flight home.

Hairdryer, ironing board, and a huge TV (which did seem slightly incongruous compared to the size of the room). Plenty of hangers, and tea and coffee facilities. Bed is very comfortable, but see comments below.","Given the size of the room, the furniture was oversized and if it had been more compact then it would’ve allowed more space for the occupier. As the hotel is probably not intended for a long stay, a large wardrobe is not necessary. It was impossible to pull out the stool to sit at the dressing table because it hit the bedside cabinet and you cannot get your legs under the dressing table.  The shower (while excellent) is positioned so that you have to edge in sideways through the small space. The basin unit in the bathroom is huge for the size of the room so again a smaller fitting would be more suitable.

The front door reception was very good, and service by those gents/staff who held a door and offered to bring bags in was noted and appreciated. Our check in staff member was also friendly. The room was very clean and well appointed. Chef was friendly at greeting us at breakfast.","The bed was a little small for a couple. Perhaps a double size, not a queen size. The room opened to an adjacent courtyard that would not be to step into. The club room we were in was probably part of two club rooms, with a locked dividing door that did not limit all sounds from guests in the adjacent club room. Breakfast did not start until 7:30 which would not be of use if wanting to be up early and out early. Front of desk staff did not greet or even look up as we walked by to our rooms. The breakfast options were not described upon sitting down. In fact, we were asked if we wanted a table for two and then told to pick our own table anyway - quite surprising. We were then asked if we wanted coffee or tea and eggs. When we asked for caffe latte, told this would be extra. At £252/night, that was unexpected. It appears the breakfast was a buffet but that eggs were prepared separately - this was assumed but not told. I was underwhelmed by the buffet.",Australia,Club Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,December 2019,3 January 2020,,

7.0,Nice but far from 5 stars,"1. Location is amazing. 5 min on foot from Paddington Starion (Heathrow express stop, 2 underground stations nearby, Hyde Park is 7 min away.) A lot of shops and restaurants around. 2. Very good room quality. Everything is new, nice and convenient. The bed is very comfortable.","1. I had a club room and it was really small for a hotel of such category. I have asked about the difference between club and standard rooms and was answered that the standard is even smaller. Can't imagine how 2 persons can fit in it. The second difference is 0.375 bottle of Chilis red wine, 2 cans of soft drinks and 2 apples. For the whole period of stay. Nothing more. 2. The ceiling in my room on the 4th floor was very law. If you suffer from claustrophobia choose another floor ) Don't choose rooms which start from 8 - they are in the basement. 3. It was cold in the room and blew from the window. (December) The room is heated only by aircon. So when you leave the room the power is switched off and no heating at all. Therefore when you return it is really cold. You have to wait for at least half an hour so that the room warms up. Very uncomfortable. 4. Only one receptionist to check in/check out. and the hotel is not very small. So I had to wait in a queue. 5. Spa and gym are jokes. Look at the pictures. The spa is a big bubble bath, and the gym is small even for 1 person. 6. Breakfast. Interesting story.  Generally, the choice is quite good but you have to be aware of it.  If you don't ask nobody will explain to you what do they have. There is a breakfast menu from which you can't understand anything. The choice in the buffet table is quite modest so you always have to ask. cooked eggs -ask, jam and honey - ask, salmon - ask. 7.

7.0,Decent Job,"I travel to London by train from the south west quite frequently and like to stay in Paddington when I do. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the station and so well located.   The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and check in was quick.  There is a restaurant that serves a decent evening meal, well priced and sensible portion sizes.  The room was comfortable with good quality fittings and bathroom furniture .  All in all, relatively expensive, but probably in line with what you'd expect for a stay in a decent hotel in London.","I read some reviews after booking - that gave me concern about windowless basement rooms.  Happily my booking wasn't 'upgraded' to one of them My only niggle was that the room was small - big enough for a double bed and not much else really.  I was travelling alone and only for one night, so it was OK - but it would have become claustrophobic after a while.

I also found the kitchen to be lacking flexibility.  Got in while they were still open but refused for us to order something. It would have been helpful given we had just gotten off a 23hr flight and were tired.

7.0,"3 star hotel with 4 star prices. Good location, but may be better alternatives in the locale.","The selection at breakfast was very good. You could also order additional food that was not displayed at the buffet (like fried eggs instead of scrambled, for example). The staff were also very friendly and helpful. The aircon in our bedroom was a godsend and was wonderful.","The WiFi was very dodgy. There is one (1) elevator that is very slow, and frankly it's not enough for the volume and frequency of passengers - often maintenance/cleaning staff would be using the elevator, meaning guests would need to wait long times to board (as an aside, the elevator says it can fit 6, but any more than 4 is a struggle). We waited 10 minutes at one point, and very often you would see guests just abandon waiting and take the stairs.The bed was very firm which, for me, is a downside. There are no windows or extractor fans in the bathroom either, meaning it steams up very quickly. The bathroom and the bedroom were much smaller than appeared in the photos.This hotel is advertised as a 4 star hotel, and has 4 star prices for staying, but I found it hard to justify that rating. In my opinion it is no more than a 3 star (perhaps its gym/spa, which we did not use or visit, is why it is 4 stars), and travellers should consider that when booking. However, if it were a 3 star with 3 star prices, it would be excellent value and a sure recommendation.",Germany,Deluxe Double Room,3 nights ·,Couple,August 2022,28 August 2022,,

The variety of food was not great. The restaurant menu/room service menu is nearly all Indian food except for just a few dishes, which made us go elsewhere to eat. A more diverse menu would be more tempting for a variety of people.It was nice to have an air conditioned room, but even after requesting our temperature to be made cooler, it was still very warm and uncomfortable and didn’t seem to work well at all.

10,Exceptional,"Just returned from a wonderful trip from the UK that started out with four nights at the Chilworth near Paddington station. We booked two rooms as we also had some friends staying with us. Had an absolutely wonderful time and the staff at the hotel could not have been more friendly and helpful. First of all the hotel could not be in a better location. Just over a city block away from Paddington station. But the friendly and professional hospitality is simply outstanding! All of the front desk staff as well as the concierge and other staff were just so incredibly helpful, friendly and accommodating. Peter and Daniel were so helpful and really went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. And the concierge, Shuja, was simply outstanding! We were coordinating with other friends and had an additional person come and stay at the hotel and he went out of his way to make sure that he could be accommodated and feel welcome even with such short notice. He took a personal interest to make sure that all was going well for us and that we were enjoying ourselves. In a large city like London during prime time travel it is so comforting to stay at a hotel where they really make you feel like family.  Shuja and the other staff at the hotel are to be complimented for their outstanding and friendly service! Have stayed at other hotels nearby in the past but this will be our favorite 4 years to come! Compliments to the management and staff of this fine establishment!",Everything was great!,United States,Deluxe Single Room,2 nights ·,Solo traveller,June 2022,30 June 2022,,

1.0,Missing item from room and loud noises made this a deeply unsatisfying stay.,The location was very good.,"I arrived at 1am due to a delayed flight. There was no hot water in the room. I reported it in the morning when I was woken up by slamming doors, and it was fixed while I was at breakfast (£20 and I was not offered more than coffee, the buffet part was very limited, definitely not worth the money). The next afternoon I noticed that my perfume was not on the desk where I thought I put it, but I would check my luggage before saying anything. The hot water was not working again that night. I reported the hot water and was told that I need to let the water run for at least 3 minutes to get hot water. I reported the perfume missing after checking my room and was told “we will fix it”. When I checked back the following day, I was told that they trust their housekeepers and I must have misplaced it. I tore apart my belongings and moved the bed twice more, and still nothing. there was no compensation other than “we trust our workers, maybe you put it somewhere”. I could overlook a lot, but my belongings going missing is where I draw the line. So deeply disappointed. for the money I paid, the value was incredibly poor. I have worked in hotels myself, so I take it very seriously if/when I do need to report something, but for a hotel that is supposedly so nice, blaming guests is just not the way to handle it. The rooms are not soundproof either, so you will be woken up by slamming doors and loud talking in the hall.",Sweden,Deluxe Single Room,5 nights ·,Solo traveller,June 2022,21 June 2022,,

Finally, unable to stand it any longer as she sopped up creamer from the table, I asked if I could get some coffee and it STILL took several delays and a few more people’s collaboration before I could get a coffee. it was not until I was checking out (a process that seemed to require 3 people) that anyone seemed seriously interested in how my stay was.

Yes, it was small, but it had everything we needed and if we didn't have something, we just picked up the phone and the staff brought it to us immediately.We had lunch at the hotel restaurant. The menu was mainly Indian food - high quality, delicious, with lots of choice, and a wait time of only 15 or 20 minutes. The only down side was the small portion size. To give you an idea, one full portion of rice was served inside a coconut half-shell. It looked more like a starter, and we were still hungry after the meal - but then again, we didn't pay a lot for it. It would still be reasonably priced if you just buy a double portion per person.We will definitely want to stay here again on future visits to London.",,United Kingdom,Compact Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,December 2021,23 December 2021,,

We had a fire alarm activation in the middle of the night (2am) we had a letter through the door the next day to say it was due to one of the other guests breaking fire, health &amp; safety regulations however when we asked reception for more information on what happened they said it was somebody taking a shower that set off the alarm. so that person was obviously lying to us because having a shower isn’t breaking the law??? The lift was the most tiny tiniest lift I had ever seen let alone used! For comfortable use it could only fit 2 people inside.

10,Exceptional hotel with amazing staff,"On arrival in this lovely hotel in a very nice area thats within a quick walk of multiple train stations we were greeted by the amazing reception staff at the The Chilworth. As they were running through all the services available just like any hotel they then surprised me and my girlfriend with an upgraded room for our anniversary, for free! We were taken aback by the kindness of the staff to have organised this for us. We were moved to a club double room and were met by flowers and complimentary drinks. The room was beautiful, the bed was very comfortable and the TV and speaker were a very nice touch.

4.0,Trip to London,Dropped off luggage first thing in the morning when we arrived. Good service from the women at reception. The breakfast service on day two was good. Carpeted floor was soft and looked clean. The bed was comfy and the shower was hot with strong water pressure. Location was close to underground.,"Service was only good when we first arrived to leave our luggage in the morning and pay on the spot. Felt like they couldn’t careless after we paid. The room was much smaller than I had imagined and bare. Didn’t have much of anything described when we booked the room. The “garden” we had was great, a lovely view of bins and broken glass on the floor. Luckily the door couldn’t be opened. Felt like anyone could have just waltzed in as we was on the ground floor. The man at reception was very rude when I had asked a question and instead of trying to help he seemed baffled and confused to my request with the expression of that is not my job and I’m not going to help you at all. At some point in the conversation he was almost shouting at me and looked visible offended like I had asked something ridiculously outrageous. From there on it really went downhill and started to question my choice in hotel. The first day down for breakfast felt like it was chaotic. No one knew what to do or was all over the place and didn’t have time to help. Overall the service was severely lacking, not at all attentive for the price and “5” stars that it shows on booking.com but when you google it, it actually shows a 3/4 star hotel.",United Kingdom,Club Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,August 2021,31 August 2021,,
5.0,Passable,Fairly clean and great location. A few people from the staff were great and very helpful.,"Just overall disappointing. Way too expensive for what they were offering. The stuff was trying their best but it wasn't working. First day we were there the breakfast was just a mess. We waited for 20 minutes to be seated and then waited another 20 minutes to be served a very mediocre English breakfast. Coffee was burnt, tea was just way too weak. It would be kind of ok if breakfast was included in our stay but since we did pay for it and quite a lot as well it was just overall disappointing. I feel that most of the staff had no idea what to do either. It felt as if the hotel just opened and people where just still figuring out what to do? Second day was a lot better but still not worth it. Anyway apart from that, the room was extremely tiny even though I booked the deluxe one so I can't imagine how small would the simple one be. The spa facilities were also booked up for the whole two days we were there so we weren't able to use that either. I am pretty sure MANY 3-star hotels would have been a lot better. Just not worth it at all and way too expensive for absolutely no reason.",Greece,Deluxe Twin Room,2 nights ·,Group,August 2021,30 August 2021,,

I had a single room on the 4th floor, it was compact but ideal for what I needed, which was basically somewhere to get my head down after a day working in London. It was well equipped and the bathroom was spotless, the shower had excellent water pressure and they supplied all standard travel sized shower gel etc.  The smell from the restaurant as I checked in was lovely so I decided to go down and get a meal to take back to my room (they do room service but I was going downstairs anyway) I ordered the Butter Chicken curry with a Garlic naan and it was so tasty and good value for money at £12.50, this is cheap for any hotel let alone a London hotel! I only paid just over £40 for the night so was not expecting much, this far exceeded my expectations and was very very good value for money.

Look at the photo of the bed - that is the size of the room. There wasn't enough space for us to get changed at the same time - one of us had to sit on the bed or go out of the room.  The shower room door opened into the room, taking up the only (small amount of) space.  The folding shower door opened inwards against the shower controls, so you had to start and adjust the shower standing in the tiny cubicle.  Anyone of more than average height or build would struggle.  And there was less than half a toilet roll left.  There was only one plug socket; the (empty) fridge close to the bottom of the bed was incredibly noisy: the green ""safety"" light by the door lit up the whole room.

No reminders to guests entering dining areas about hand sanitizer and mask wearing.

Also despite being told when we checked in that our room would not be cleaned during our stay and if clean towels were required just ask. We went out for the day and when we returned our bedroom door was ajar (security risk) and clearly they had been in to clean room despite what he had been told on check in.

2.0,The shock of receiving a wrong telephone bill that was charged to our room when we did not incur it.,Location was convenient.,"We got a shock at checkout when we were told that there was a 3 hours international call made from our hotel room's phone in the wee hours when we were asleep and were not using the phone. Besides, the number dialed was not a number we were familiar with nor did we know which country it belonged to.There was also an unauthorised transaction made on my credit card days before my check-in which I only found out after the stay. These were unacceptable incidents and extremely shocking and distressing for guests to know that there could have been a security breach or unauthorised transactions made from the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for guests due to the above two serious incidents.Edit: The hotel staff contacted me regarding the incidents above. It was not the first time that a telephone bill was assigned wrongly to the guest room due to their IT system. Considering that this was supposed to be a 4* hotel, such incidents should not happen. The separate payment charged to my card earlier on was a pre-authorisation on the card before my stay. However, this was not conveyed to me during the check-in. It would have been good if the staff had mentioned this at the start and reassured us that this preauthorisation payment would be refunded to us.

There was a constant vibrating dull noise throughout the night coming from outside the room which was irritating and disrupted sleep. The bathroom also had such bad ventilation that a shower longer than 2 minutes was uncomfortable due to sheer amount of steam. This steam then set off some sort of alarm which resulted in phone calls and 4 physical visits from reception staff at different times. At one point reception walked right into the room using their key card whilst I was in a towel getting ready which is completely inappropriate. Was then told I must keep the bathroom door closed to which I confirmed it was shut and had been the entire time, with the exception of exiting the bathroom to enter the main room - such a short amount of time having the door open should not have set off any alarms had the rooms been properly ventilated.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,December 2021,3 December 2021,,

The jacuzzi has a strong bleach smell (Not chlorine) and just didn’t feel right to get in it. The breakfast was awful for what you pay. I was hesitant to stay one night or two when I was booking and ended up staying only one night, I ended up booking blu radiation Edwardian hotel for the other night which was a much nicer hotel at a fraction of the price too.

We didn’t use the small pool because felt uncomfortable as lacking communication and items which was suppose to be available.  in our room the bathroom had a ball of what looks like someone pube hair. there was no drinks in the rooms mini bar fridge. having breakfast was horrible. the sausages looked great but my husband cut into his and it was pink. the scrambled eggs I got but didn’t eat as see little brown bits inside but I think because it was the last of it at bottom of the heat tray. the coffee is room is normal instant Nescafé decafe and the milk in the little pots which are suppose to be long life milk curdled our coffees so we didn’t drink them. in the restaurant the coffee has an extreme bitter taste I don’t know if that’s down to the amount of coffee used or if it’s just not nice filter coffee. the rooms are not cleaned properly you can see that on the tv control and hair ball on the floor. after breakfast we left and went to the Hilton hotel and it costs us 2 pounds more for a king room with breakfast, amazing pod coffee in the rooms, sparkling and still water. fridge. haven’t had breakfast yet at the Hilton but we opted into having it delivered to our room with cream for coffee !! all for 2 pounds more.I had high hopes for the chileworth :( unfortunately we won’t be recommending to family /friends or returning.",United Kingdom,Compact Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,November 2021,13 November 2021,,

What a total nightmare.  Didn't wake as we hadn't had any sleep.  Basement room.  Two very large, very noisy  generators outside. (See imagery). All night.  Vibrations.  Too be honest at one point we thought it was residual noise from the nearby underground.  It wasn't.  Informed reception  did not have much to say even though its obvious they were aware.  How could they not.  Plus i have now noted prior complaints in regard to the same.  Supposed to be a deluxe double (larger than most rooms) in London.  Total tonk.  God knows what a compact double would have been like.  Nice furnishings though.  Could just get into bed on my side.  Via the curtains.Room also has two very bright green lights located near door.  Now being a small double room with just about enough room to swing a cat.  These lights light up most of the room.  Not ideal.  I travel a lot, moreso prior to the covid issue.  However  I can say that this was the worse nights stay in any hotel I have ever had and hope to ever have.  Twice, I called reception no response.  I was contemplating sleeping in reception.  The train ride home was quieter.  There was also an office for the cleaners ne t door  so once you wade through bags of laundry etc to get to your room.  You could quite happily sit in the bathroom listening to their complaints.  Comical to say the least.  In this instance I feel let down by both booking.com and this hotel.  I will definitely never use this hotel again.  A travelodge would be by far a  much better option.  Spoilt what should have been an enjoyable weekend.

My upgraded room for a 1 night stay was maintained when I extended for another night. Very pleasant reception with efficient check-in. Location is quiet but still close enough to Paddington station.,"I didn't enjoy a single aspect of the breakfast. My detailed comments would be unprintable here, but as an example the scrambled egg had the apperance and texture of thick sheets of rubber laid on top of one another. Filter coffee was the only option which contrasts with many cheaper hotels offering several options from a bean to cup machine. At checkout I was one of several guests complaining about the poor breakfast quality. They did refund the cost and also got the impression the problem was recognised. Refund was a nice gesture. The spa was unavailable but this is understandable because of the demand and the need for social distancing.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Solo traveller,September 2021,10 September 2021,,

My partner profusely apologised on two occasions on my behalf as it was him they approached. Was made to think this was dealt with then when I went to check out, the same situation was mentioned again and the woman was rude. I apologised multiple times and she was simply not accepting and continued to repeat herself in front of multiple staff members at the desk which made me very uncomfortable. I then said I have many complaints that I had not planned to mention but since I was being approached about the same issue for the third time I would now like to make a complaint and she responded accusing me of only doing this because I had been pulled about the complaint about me. I had already taken pictures of all the issues prior to this!

We booked a deluxe room but in reality deluxe meant no more than a foot around the perimeter of the bed. The room was not very clean and had not had the furniture dusted for a long time. Mirror was broken. Also although it did not matter to me, this room would be unsuitable for anyone with mobility issues because as you walked into the room there were more steps to go down. Lift was totally inadequate for the size of hotel. We were given no information about how to access spa facilities.

4.0,Disappointing,The location was convenient to get to from Euston. Chris and his female colleague were very welcoming on the second day,On arrival I was asked for an additional payment as a deposit and ID which was not stated anywhere prior to attending . Then I was directed to a room in the basement which was definitely not the deluxe double room that I booked. I immediately returned to the reception desk stating that I was not happy with the room. I was told that there was no other room available and that I could move to another room the following day. I slept for two hours on that first night - the room was cold. When I complained I was told that he would put the heating on. I brought my luggage to reception and to be fair after a day out : on my return a different room was allocated and the lovely Chris had already placed our luggage in the room. This room was much better with a window overlooking the street. We had two spoons instead of the one in the previous room and a bit more room to move around . I was told about meals but no mention of other facilities such as the spa etcSomeone else in their review mention the nice touch of peddles and folded animal towels - no such luck in either rooms. My daughter had a single room at £120 which was lovely and adequate for one . However I felt I should have booked two single rooms and save money on the deluxe double room . However I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chris for his welcoming and great assistance.

Nobody was distanced, clean cutlery and glassware was nowhere to be seen, 'self service' tea and coffee but no cups, until we were directed to a table full of dirty and clean cups all mixed together, impossible to tell what had been used or not.

I had booked a club double room as a present for my partners birthday but they told me I had only reserved a standard double.

However, it was in the basement, there was no window to open and the room smelt musty...Hardly the '5 star' experience we were hoping for. This is the type of hotel that spends all its budget on a fancy looking website rather than making the place as nice as possible for their guests. The hotel staff were rude and unhelpful.

5.0,Extremely disappointed. Definitely not 5 *,Location ShowerChris on reception was excellent,"A deluxe double &amp; deluxe single was booked for 4 nights. I was looking forward to my stay as I have never stayed in a 5* hotel &amp; was chuffed when on arrival the double had been upgraded to a club room. However, both rooms were in the basement with views onto different fire escapes, The club also having the inlet pipe for the spa running across the window and the emergency exit adjacent to it. Neither had double glazing or a safe so were very vulnerable. They smelled very damp which was reported to reception with the action taken of opening the window.  The single, which despite being a deluxe was very tiny had tea &amp; coffee but no kettle. It had space for a fridge but none there. The club had no hairdryer and the underfloor heating in the bathroom did not work. There was no information as to how to operate the technology in the room eg heating/AC, do not disturb etc and the lights kept going off, even with the key card in the slot behind the door. After the second night my daughter said that the staff congregated outside her (single) room on the fire escape to smoke and chat during the night which woke her up. This was reported to the reception who agreed to move her to another room - on the 5 floor.  We asked if we could also be moved to be kept together. This was eventually agreed but we would not have the club room, just the deluxe which was booked. Both these second rooms were very small but had the kettle, safe, hair dryer and the underfloor heating worked although the floor tiles were broken (5*?)There was a category of room below deluxe and I don't know how a room could be any smaller as both rooms were barely larger than the bed. We had to turn sideways to shuffle round the bed &amp; there was nowhere to store the suitcase. The double room had a microwave in it but I'm not sure why as if you were to use it to heat up food there was no where to sit and eat it apart from sitting on the bed itself .

1.0,Disappointing and won’t be recommending or stay there again.,The location but that’s about all I can say was good.,The first thing we noticed was how cramped the room was. We had to walk sideways to get to the side of the bed. The bed was next to the window which had really dirty stained curtains. This was extremely disappointing as paid so much for the hotel. The walls were also very dirty had lots of stains. We couldn’t open our suitcase on the suitcase holder or on the floor as no space so we had to open on the bed.

1.0,The chilworth Paddington is a lousy hotel.,,"During my 6 nights’ stay at The Chilworth Paddington, my room number was 108. The phone jack was broken and I could not call reception. I informed the receptionist twice that the phone was not working. A staff member came to check it twice and promised that it would be fixed the next day. Unfortunately, nobody came to fix the phone during the entire 6 nights’ stay. I had to go to the lobby each time that I needed bottles of water, instant coffee packets, and towels which were never replaced. The lack of landline was dangerous because if I had a medical or other emergency, or simply a need for service I could not call for help because I did not have an international cell phone.Once, I asked for packets of instant coffee in the evening and was shocked that the staff member told me that: “I should have hot chocolate and that coffee would keep me awake”. I insisted and he brought two packets of decaffeinated coffee. I had to return downstairs to ask him for two caffeinated packets and that I don’t drink decaffeinated coffee.I put the “do not disturb” on the door yet someone entered the room nonetheless. The hotel’s wifi is poor.I had lunch at the restaurant and shortly after paying the check, which was approved, the waiter came to knock on my room’s door to inform me that the charge was denied. I had to show him that the card and charge belonged to someone else. The waiter did not apologize.I had breakfast once at the restaurant. The host and the waiter asked me for my room number which I assumed was required to charge the card associated with the room. However, when I finished breakfast and as I was leaving, the host and two waiters abrasively approached me to require that I pay before leaving. It was very embarrassing and I had to explain that I thought that the purpose of giving my room number was for my card to be charged. And they did not apologize.

The location was good.,"This was not 5-stars as advertised, consequently my review is very harsh based on management’s deception. The staff are not to blame. The furniture in our Club Double Room was old and filthy. I requested for a room with a view, but the view was of a dirty rooftop and air conditioning chillers.  The only elevator in the hotel was always busy in the mornings, and was used mostly by housekeeping staff.  I and my wife had to use the stairs frequently. The bathroom was good, but more space was need to place our toiletries at sink level, not underneath the sink. The shower holes were blocked, so the water flow was multi-directional.  Housekeeping staff entered the room when we were in our room on 3 occasions in the morning.

So we were more than happy initially.","Unfortunately this is where our impressions were slowly slipping. We were given the card to our room with an instruction of where the room was and that was it. We weren't advised on how and when we could book breakfast if we wanted to, or how to book a table at the restaurant. We weren’t told what time check out was and there was no mention of the spa or gym.When we got to the room, it was lovely and clean and the petals on the bed &amp; animal towels were a LOVELY touch and we were grateful for this. However the room was so so small, I could not think what the room before the upgrade was like. We go on many cruises and cruise cabins are bigger than the room we had. The bed was so small, my husband is 6 foot 3 inches and I am pregnant, so we both felt as if we were falling off the bed. I also felt that the pillows were really uncomfortable and hard. I hardly slept to be honest.Usually when we go to hotel rooms (even in a Travelodge) there is usually a leaflet with information on Breakfast, location, how to contact people, spa and gym times, how to use the buttons in the room (as there were many and we had no idea how to use them). There was nothing like this to hand, which would have been handy and would provide us with all the information we needed.The tea and coffee facilities did not include a spoon, so were unable to stir our beverages and they were never replenished while we were there. We had to leave a note for the cleaner to top us up with more sugar and milk, and we had to go down to the restaurant to receive a spoon. This is usually basic maintenance and was quite disappointed to see it wasn't done when we arrived in late.All of the things listed above, we would usually not do anything about, however the most disappointing part of our stay was the gym and spa facilities.",United Kingdom,Compact Double Room,3 nights ·,Couple,August 2021,21 August 2021,,

Have had more choice and better English breakfast in practically everywhere else I have stayed. The hotel itself is certainly not 4star standard. It is in need of an overhaul and sprucing up. The entrance is threadbare carpet and a gloomy reception area. Not a good welcoming feel. It is a has been hotel and is deperately in need of refurbishment. I felt I was staying in a different hotel from the one I had read about in the reviews. There were more staff than guests but most just standing about doing nothing. Again certainly not trained to 4 star standard. On the whole I was most disappointed in this hotel.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Single Room,3 nights ·,Solo traveller,June 2021,7 June 2021,,
3.0,Don’t stay in room 002,The staff are friendly.,We stayed in room 002. The window looks out onto a shaft so if you want a view this isn’t for you. There is no natural light in the room. The temperature dial was faulty. The toilet did not flush so we requested a swap but the receptionist sent a maintenance person to fix the issue. The flush appeared to be fixed however later that night it stopped working again. As it was late at night we did not report this and decided to report in the morning. The toilet would clear after 4/5 semi flushes. In the morning the shower did not work properly. There was no hot water at all and the dials were faulty. There was also old food left in the fridge. We only stayed 1 night so there wasn’t much for the staff to do to help us as we were ready to leave ASAP. We were very disappointed as we have stayed here before and had a better experience. We are waiting for a response as regards compensation.,United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,June 2021,5 June 2021,,

1.0,Bloody terrible experience,,"Not a hotel that I would recommend for someone wanting to have a tourist experience in London.We booked this hotel for 3 nights at £250 per night. When first checked in, we were told that we got the “upgraded” room - which turned out to be in the basement with no windows. So we checked if it is possible to switch to a proper room with a window. Firstly, the hotel staff said no room available apart from this one, only after we said then we had to cancel that they gave us a room in the G floor, which was at the back of the reception and was very loud. Service is also very suboptimal, we do not see any towels or toothpaste in the room and it took very long time for the staff to bring it over. The room itself was also very small and not clean. We spotted flies in the room, and both rooms we stayed have stains/dust on the bedsheet. The second night, we were moved to the higher floor, however the room was very small and we cannot even open the luggage case on the floor with a £250 rate per night. Due to some personal reason, we have to leave early for one night, so we submitted the request to check out one day early but the hotel rejected our request and still charging the room for one extra night.Overall, not a pleasant experience and I would recommend people to avoid this place.",Hong Kong (China),Compact Double Room,3 nights ·,Solo traveller,September 2022,27 September 2022,,

It all started off with discrimination on arrival. Me and my girlfriend who was dressed very casually did not get greeted by the porter which I dont have a problem but the caucasian couple  in their mid 40's were offered tea, coffee, wine and greeted in a polite manner.Second of all they gave us room 803, this is not the room that was advertise on online. The room view was of the awful, please find attached pictures, the room also had electrical problems, clearly this came from a previously leak which had not been fixed, you can clearly see from the outside and they still rented the room to us. The electrical kept cutting off after two minutes on top of that we got electric shock three times. I complained many times but nothing was done about this, and it clearly shows that the manager did even call me back. Eventually after getting electric shock they finally moved us. this was around 12:30am.  I also believe the room 803 had bed bugs as I was bitten, please find attached pictures.By the time 12:30am we was so hungry and exhausted that we had to order food, the porter bought us a menu of a kebab shop in kilburn high road, I was shocked that a 5* hotel would do this and not have late night service, on top of that the porter took £10 tip for the food. On the menu the chicken burger and chips we ordered was £6 but they charged us  £16, I did not have the energy to argue. I also complaint in the morning about this but nothing was done.To conclude my stay this hotel is only for middle aged caucasian (white) people get the luxury service, to the tourist please be careful",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,February 2020,26 February 2020,,

It was a scene out a nightmare horror movie.,"The pictures are misleading , the beds and decor do not resemble the rooms .Ordered breakfast , once my reciept arrived none was specified , sent the hotel an email recieved no response. At check in was “ upgraded to a better room”Before you check in , you are supposed to sign responsibility for the items in the room .Guess what ? The tv was broken half screen and remote was working, i got a room with a balcony door with a fire exit , i have dust allergies and it flared up , the balcony was filthy and dusty . The room had dust all over them , surely a 4 star hotel has got dusters in store . The day front desk receptionist are cold , rude and very unwelcoming .I had a good chat with chris he said he was the manager and he apologised but surely i wouldnt step into that hotel even if they paid me .There are no social distancing available in the hotel , people will squeeze in the lift with you and you will get barged in the lift even if you were the first person inside .I am really disappointed .Worst hotel experience of my well travelled life.The carpets are still giving me nightmares , the mini fridges do not work and my wife ordered towels and was given dark stained white towels .We live in a covid pandemic , i would suggest everyone to stay away and in your homes or sleep in your cars for safety and hygiene level .And i work as a paramedic i would know",United Kingdom,,2 nights ·,Couple,April 2021,29 April 2021,,
