There were 2 shower options, a regular shower head and another that is attached to the ceiling right above you. Water pressure + heating was excellent. Bathroom amenities provided - soap, shampoo, conditioner, extra toilet rolls, lotion.Room service - food was reasonably priced and fairly cheap for a hotel and halal options available. Location - literally just about a minute walk to tube station (Earl's Court) with many grocery stores/ restaurants nearby.","Customer care - I waited at the reception to check in for quite a while. They were busy to begin with which I understood. But when they served another customer before me who just arrived, I was a little annoyed. Also, the receptionist dealing with my check in was sneezing/coughing multiple times into their bare hands which I was uncomfortable with as they were handling my debit card and room key card. At least they apologised but I would have preferred if they washed their hands rather than just squirt a tiny bit of sanitiser.The bed - the double bed was huge, but it was two single beds put together so I couldn't sleep in the middle. Plus, both mattresses had different ""firmness"" with one more firm and the other that sunk in. Old(ish) furniture/ carpet - Furniture looks a bit run down and the chair in the room at the desk sunk in and was uncomfortable (but it's not terrible). Carpet was also not very clean with some stains (but I turned a blind eye to this)Lift - it was so much slower than most lifts, even at cheaper hotels (I could walk up the stairs to the 4th floor faster than the lift) BUT having a lift is better than no lift so it's not the worst.

We were early arriving, and they had our rooms ready with very little wait (and tagged our luggage to hold so we could go on out and explore if we wanted to). They also accommodated our request to have three rooms together.Prior to arriving, I had reached out to the hotel with some questions and they were very helpful. The rooms were nice (on the small side, but that seems to be the norm in London) and the showers had the best pressure I’ve ever seen :) Air conditioning was cool on hot days- a luxury we won’t take for granted after other places we visited on this trip. I would stay here again and definitely recommend it!","Breakfast was not great - no a la carte options and the buffet wasn’t very well stocked the day we gave it a try. Everyone was doing their best, and the host was very pleasant. When we were leaving he told me they had just brought breakfast back recently since before COVID, so they might still be working out the kinks (and everywhere we went in England, places seemed to be short staffed.) Also, if you’re a coffee drinker, the coffee in the rooms is instant.

Greater attention to details in the bathroom which although was clean, was a little tired in places.  The hotel calls the restaurant the Turmeric Kitchen - an Indian restaurant.  There was no sign of a menu either at the restaurant or in the room.  We decided not to eat there as recent reviews also suggested things had gone down hill a bit.  It also seemed very quiet when we passed it in the evenings.  Breakfast was Ok but I think a lot of the food had been under warm lamps for some while so things like the bacon and scrambled egg were pretty dry.

Also, breakfast was pretty great I did not find myself bored of it in the six days spent there. As for the WiFi, not only was it a free one that anyone could connect into, it wouldn't allow me to use many apps (including social media) nor visit many websites beyond Google/basic functions. I have no idea why this is the case, but upon relooking at reviews with specific mentions of WiFi problems I realized I was not the only one facing such an issue. Still give this a 4/5 overall as I managed without the wifi by paying for my own data service, however, if you depend on the free wifi you might want to consider staying elsewhere.

8.0,A happy discovery !,"Was looking for a one night stay in London to cover a theatre evening without rushing for train home. Found Park Grand near Earls Court and was surprised to find what looked like a very new building in a typical Earls Court Terrace of (former) grand apartments. 2 minutes walk to Earls Court Station. Reception staff very helpful, professional and friendly and we checked in around 1.45 pm to a lovely room, more spacious than I expected, excellent bath/shower/toilet and a comfortable chair (which is not always the case). Plus writing pad and pen which is even rarer. As well as coffee/tea facilities, hotel provided 2 small bottles of water-again, very much appreciated. We opted to enjoy leisurely breakfast next morning which was delivered in spacious restaurant area by very attentive staff and good buffet choices. Amazingly this was only £ 10 per person. As the hotel room was just £ 114 this represented excellent value for money and I've already booked my next one night's stay for a business meeting in November.

This was something that was ideal for us given the places we wanted to get to. I must also say that we found the staff at Earls Court Station to be very helpful with advice on what to do about getting around. We felt that our Superior Double Room was ideal and spacious enough for our needs.,"The breakfast, I felt, could have been a bit more varied. It remained virtually the same for every one of the 4 days we were there. That said, the staff here were more than happy to help where they could. For example, there are several a la carte breakfast dishes available though this was an additional cost to the £15 already paid for breakfast. These included omelettes, pancakes and other items.",United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,4 nights ·,Family,November 2019,9 December 2019,,

8.0,A very good hotel with only minor niggles.,"Excellent location in a quiet side street about two minutes' walk from Earls Court tube station. The quietness of the street meant no road noise or other nuisance at night. Comfy bed. Excellent reception staff who came out to the street when they saw me struggling with luggage. Very fast check-out, when I raised one complaint they immediately put our taxi to the station on their account, a nice touch. Very good value for money. This is a well-run (mostly) hotel in great location. I'd recommend it.","Room too cold, and twiddling with the air conditioning control achieved nothing. I mentioned this at checkout and was informed that room temperatures are controlled by reception! Then why doesn't it say so in the big fat book supplied in each room? I looked in every drawer and every cupboard but couldn't find the hairdryer. I phoned reception who said it was under the desk. This is invisible to a first-time customer, and why doesn't it say so in the big fat book supplied in every room?As ever, in a hotel bathroom, there is no where near enough space on either side of the bathroom washbasin to unload your own toiletries; yet there is space to fit a wider shelf. This happens in about 95% of hotel bathrooms all over the world. Why? Because the people who design hotel bathrooms do not use them themselves.",United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,December 2019,16 December 2019,1,

6.0,Great location / pleasant staff / interior somewhat cramped.,"Excellent location with Earls Court tube station within a 3 - 4 minute walking distance. Staff were very pleasant. One in particular by the name of Gurpreet was very quick and helpful about directions and accessing Luton airport from the hotel. Restaurant was spacious and breakfast was good with plenty of choice. The 2nd. morning I made a bad seating choice for breakfast in restaurant - right under an air conditioning unit / not ideal when you're having a ""cooked"" / hot breakfast!","Reception area has a somewhat ""cramped"" feeling about it. Doesn't give a great impression as you enter the hotel, but I guess in these areas of London, space is tight. Similarly, the bedroom I was in / at the very end of corridor on 1st. floor (110 or 112?) was a standard room which I thought was very small. There was a persistent background sound in this room when all power was turned off for the night. Couldn't sleep. The hotel was full that 1st. night, so I couldn't move to a different room. However, they did offer me an option to move the following day. When I returned from the event I was attending, they showed me a room in the basement, but this too had exactly the same background noise (when all switches / air con and power was turned off) so I stayed where I was! When I told them at reception that both rooms had the exact same background low humming noise, a lady offered me noise-cancelling headphones.

6.0,The only thing that's grand about this place is disappointment.,"Location is good, close to the metro and on a quiet street. Breakfast is decent. However, they tell you to pay if you want a cappuccino instead of normal coffee.","The hotel in general is dated: you can see signs of wear in the elevator and in the room. Here's a hinge missing, here's a window handle broken. Here's mold in the bathroom. Here's a hole in the curtain (probably left by a cigarette). The first room had hard and old pillows that need to be replaced.Cleanliness. Don't get me started. There was constant noise in our first room (112) at night and for the second night we asked to be moved. When I entered the bathroom, I saw a distinct shoeprint on the shower floor. Along with small curly back hairs. Ew. The sheets looked like they were washed and ironed, but still had dirty stains on them.Also, in our first room the maid put body lotion along with shampoo and shower gel and the second room had conditioner but no lotion. Are hygiene products given out randomly? Also, housekeeping didn't replenish tea when cleaning. There were also soap/cleaner stains on metal parts of the shower.Staff. We were promised free breakfast for the first night. We came to the restaurant and the waiter wasn't informed the day before. We stood there like two idiots waiting for them to decide if they'll give us free breakfast. Finally they did and then wanted to charge us for cappuccino :) The maid rang the bell at 8 am in the morning. We didn't have the 'do not disturb sign' to be fair, but I don't think many people are out of their rooms at this time already. Never happened to us before in any other hotel. Staff is also smoking in front of the main entrance to the hotel. This doesn't give you a pleasant feeling.Soundproofing. Doesn't exist.

Close to everything.,We have stayed in this hotel for the second time and probably the last.We were offered an “upgraded” room which was located in the basement. There was a bad damp smell. There was a mold on shower door. The upgrade referred to its size but to be honest I would much prefer a smaller room with windows facing street than windows facing the back of the building where all the air conditioning fan systems are located.

The cleanliness of my room was immaculate and was of a large size for a double room with large windows that had a view of the impressive Kensington architecture. The hotel is a very short walk from the tube station, around 2-3 mins at the most which is brilliant if going out late and also around 10-15 mins away from the West end and Oxford street.Overall I would definitely re-visit for my next city break to London and I highly recommend Park Grand London Kensington to anyone considering this hotel.",There was nothing not to like about the hotel.,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·,Family,March 2022,21 March 2022,1,

4.0,Not good enough,The staff were very friendly and professional. Decent shower. Excellent location.,"We were stuck in what I can only describe as the naughty corner in room 005. Up one floor, down a corridor, then down a grubby flight of stairs and into the farthest corner of the hotel. The room was very small and although there was a two door wardrobe one of them could only open about 3 inches due to a bedside table. The extractor fan in the bathroom was almost completely ineffective. The worst thing however was the smell of cannabis in the room. I can only assume that it was from people outside the back of the hotel smoking weed. They did offer to move us the next morning, but as it was only a base for two nights we didn't bother. Won't book this hotel again. There is a Premier Inn round the corner or an Ibis Style a few doors down and we'd have been better off going to either of them. 4 stars? I don't think so.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,March 2022,14 March 2022,,

The large room was spotless and bed was super comfy. Only downside for me would be it would have been nice to have had a proper coffee machine in the room but fresh coffee served with breakfast so it was fine. The breakfast buffet offered lots of choice and definitely filled us up for the day.The hotel was in an amazing location for restaurant's,bars,shops,parks and museum's.

The manager Giles is a pleasant guy but either has problems recruiting good staff or is incapable of getting the best out of the existing staff. On our first full day there we returned to the hotel at about15h00 exhausted and looking forward to a rest only to find that our room had not been touched in our absence since 8h00 notwithstanding the fact that we had engaged the service light before leaving that morning. After complaining a cleaner was sent to the room while we vacated for at least an hour. On our return the room had at best been given a cursory once over. The bed cover had simply been pulled straight without the linen underneath having been straightened. A sweet paper on the bedside table had not been cleared away. Nether the towels nor the toiletries had been replaced or replenished. Indeed the wet towels had simply been rolled up and displayed as if they had been replaced. A further complaint finally saw the job done properly but at the cost to us of a further hour cooling our heels. On our third day  this entire procedure was repeated as if on Ground Hog Day. A further meeting with Giles was held during which we were informed that the cleaners had until 16h00 each day to attend to the rooms. On other occasions the dining room did not open at the advertised 7h00. Annoying when you have planned your day. Sometimes queuing was required to access the woefully inadequate dining room space for breakfast. This no doubt exacerbated by the fact that the hotel also seeks to accommodate so called ""walk ins"" notwithstanding the inconvenience to residents. The lift (which I suspect is powered by a steam engine so laboured is its functioning) was not once cleaned during our 4 day stay. Indeed when we used it for the last time yesterday I noted to my dismay that a piece of paper which was on the floor of the lift on our arrival was still there  undisturbed 4 days later.",South Africa,Deluxe Double Room,4 nights ·,Couple,October 2022,15 October 2022,,

6.0,"It's a place you'd book for its function, location and convenience","Staff at the front desk were friendly and dealt with our queries in a swift manner. The location is great, very close to the Tube and very easy to wander around. It felt like a safe place to stay. The room was clean and very quiet despite facing the street. The windows allow in plenty of light and air when needed. I liked that instead of hanging a tag on the door, you simply had a button to say if you needed the room to be cleaned or if you were sleeping.","Breakfast wasn't great - it seemed like the breakfast room was understaffed. Dishes and glasses were piled up on the counter at the back of the room and were left for quite a while on empty tables. Also, the breakfast felt very basic, it wasn't communicated to us that we could request certain things like a type of egg for example - We saw other guests do this. The coffee was awful, like the texture of treacle.The hotel definitely needs some sprucing up, there are parts of it that are a bit grubby e.g. bannisters on the stairwell and carpets and the dining area (as mentioned above).",Ireland,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,October 2022,8 October 2022,,

Again had to go back to reception to complain and advised that I had booked a double bed, again without issue was offered another room, advised this was a further upgrade to a Superior Club double room, once again this did not meet the description on booking.com.  Rooms were very tired and in need of an upgrade, all drawers on furniture were stiff and difficult to open, in my room the bathroom vanity mirror which looked like a touch light mirror did not light up and was not well secured to the wall.

Picked up waste bin in main room to move it and this had a loose bottom and fell out.  Stair well carpet was dirty with what looked like paint stains.  On return from a theatre trip the evening of our stay my friend had hurt her ankle so we asked at reception for some ice and also a couple of bottles of soft drinks only to find the bar closed at 10.00pm and room service had also stopped at this time and staff had no access to the bar etc.  On a couple of occasions late that night I popped out for a cigarette, on both occasions there was no one on reception, main door was open and no real security to ensure that only hotel guests could access the hotel so this really needs addressing.",United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·,Group,July 2022,13 July 2022,,

We were instructed that we should leave our bags in the room and they would move the bags on our behalf.  My companion inadvertently left an outfit in the closet.  When she remembered and contacted the front desk, the room was occupied.   My companion had to follow-up with the front desk regarding the status of locating the outfit.  When the front desk finally followed-up, she was told the guest occupying indicated there wasn't an outfit in the closet and there was nothing that could be done. The room very small....it really is only large enough for one person..... There isn't any room in the bathroom.  The drain sink for the shower is in the middle of the shower.  The shower mat that was provided was filthy.  Had to request a new one.  In the middle of our final night, the toilet started running after it was flushed and it wouldn't stop.  Meaning, it couldn't be used.  When I called the front desk, a staff person came up to the room and could not fix the issue.  He indicated that they would send someone up when the maintenance staff arrived at 8 am.  I advised that we were checking out and needed to shower and use the restroom.  I had to ask if there was another room that could be used due to broken toilet, they returned with keys to a room on the 5th floor and we were on the 1st floor.   Spoke with a manager upon check out who indicated they would follow-up with Booking.com who in turn would follow-up with me.

Comfortable bed.,"Supposedly we were ’upgraded’ and our new room was ‘downstairs’ - is that OK? Well as we had never been here before couldn’t really have an opinion. Downstairs meant the basement. Via a maze of corridors, stairs down, steps up and stairs down, stained carpets, staff quarters with their doors open, we finally arrived at our room. The size of room was probably an ‘upgrade’ but I think I would have preferred a smaller one that wasn’t ‘downstairs’. There were patio doors onto a small square patio surrounded by concrete, with old plant pots and rubbish thrown from above. The curtains were closed, so room was dark. Someone was speaking on their phone in the room above and we could hear the conversation. The room was COLD (it was 3C outside and a cold wind). We checked the thermostat and put it to 27C. Asked at reception and they confirmed the heating was now on. We went out for the evening and when we came back it didn’t seem any warmer.

For a 4 star hotel, in this day and age - you'd expect a bit better. The water pressure in the shower is below-par, to say the least. The TV in the room also needs to be updated - we are in 2022 - not 2007. The internet quality is woeful - constantly dropping in and out! Definitely not a 4 star hotel. More of a mediocre 3 star hotel. The W14 Hotel is a better hotel - also better value for money, as it is usually cheaper over there. Overall the hotel is massively overrated - and the positive reviews we read before booking the hotel certainly led us to believe we were actually going to a 4 star hotel.

When we complained about this room they immediately moved us to a bigger room on the fifth floor which was much better, but it makes me wonder why they put us in the first room to begin with when they obviously know this is a big problem.

4.0,"Overall is fair to say we were very disappointed with being transferred to The Chilworth, Paddington",Some aspects of the aesthetics of the hotel were appealing. Most of the hotel staff were friendly and approachable.,"We ended up being transferred to The Chilworth Hotel in Paddington. Firstly, this was an issue because all of the restaurants and bars which we had booked were all around Kensington &amp; Covent Garden so this meant issues with travelling considering most of the tube is shut at night. For the inconvenience of this we were given a complimentary continental breakfast which was extremely disappointing, for two people we received two miniature croissants, 2 bits of cold toast, 2 small boxes of cereal which were not eaten due to there being no choice of cereal and 2 small yogurts with a banana and apple, when we had left breakfast it was fair to say we were still substantially hungry. Secondly, we paid for a larger room with larger facilities, we ended up with a small room with 2 single beds pushed together with minimal room around the bed which was a huge disappointment and the bathroom was extremely small and I struggled to have a comfortable shower due to the shower head being so low and the space in the shower cubical being minimal. There was also issues with the power on the first night when we checked in, the power kept turning off after a minute which we were baffled by, we went down to the hotel reception in the morning and they had a little chuckle and gave us more key cards to put in the power slot, I found this to be inconvenient when trying to get ready in the evening and rushing around trying to get to places on time because of the changed location. The bed was also an issue with it being two single beds pushed together as it meant there was an uncomfortable gap in the middle of the both of us. Also there was a mini fridge which would have been a good addition but due to it being uneven any bottles you put in there just rolled straight to the door and then when the door was opened just fell on the floor which was slightly annoying when waking up in the middle of the night for a cold drink. Value for money was certainly not the case at The Chilworth.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,August 2020,17 August 2020,,

All the same, this should not be advertised as a hotel that's particularly suitable for light sleepers, I think. The bed linen felt rather cheap, too.I couldn't turn some of the lights off in my room without removing my entry card from its slot.

10,Great Place to Stay in London,The staff were extremely friendly and attentive they even left a card in room wishing happy birthday and a small bottle of wine which was totally unexpected 😊 The room was clean and comfortable and the price of 3 course meal on an evening was only £15.99 per person and could not fault the food. Good location for Earls Court tube station which is in zone 1 and only a 2 min walk away at the end of the street. Or if you use the over ground West Brompton is a mere 10 - 15 min walk away depending how fast you walk.
