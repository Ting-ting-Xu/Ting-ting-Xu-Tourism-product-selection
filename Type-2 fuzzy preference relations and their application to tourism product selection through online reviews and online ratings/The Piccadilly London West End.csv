Toiletries were nice. Beds were comfortable. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was tasty and fresh. Continental and cooked available. Poached eggs done perfectly. We were given an upgrade of room for my sister as I had mentioned when booking it was for her 60th celebration.",We had booked 3 rooms for 3 females. My room  didn’t have a window. I feel you should be informed when you book a room without a window and the price should reflect it. I didn’t complain and got the feeling if I had they would have changed the room for me but it may have been on a different floor from my sisters. The good point about not having a window is there is no traffic or people noise. Also the room didn’t have a minibar as advertised. Just a fridge that didn’t appear to work. I had to ask to have a hairdryer too. There are no coffee makers too as advertised. You do get a kettle and tea/coffee sachets.

We explained our issues with the breakfast service and they were very understanding and offered an immediate refund. The bathroom had a very odd glass window (see pictures) but we loved the fact that it could be made opaque when in use.,"Breakfast. Not a lot to say other than it was inedible.  We were missed when cooked orders were being taken and had to request someone come over. When our food did arrive it was wrong, twice! We were offered poached eggs but got scrambled which wouldn't have been a massive issue but they were wet scrambled eggs, not fully cooked. Watching the eggs being cooked from the toast station I'm not surprised - the cook didn't seem able to get poached eggs out of the pan and threw water from a previously used plate in the bin behind her, missing by quite a bit and thus making the space behind the bar a potentially dangerous place to be. When we did get food it wasn't nice. There were boiled new potatoes, unusual choice but considering they tasted like old oil or out of date butter I wasn't going to keep going. The one slice of bacon was OK, but the single chipolata sausage wasn't cooked properly. I managed to eat some egg but left the rest of my breakfast as by then I was feeling quite queasy. As for our room, a premier twin, it was comfortable and mostly clean but the windows were dirty between each set of double glazed units and I was unable to open any more than 1cm if at all.",United Kingdom,Premier Twin Room,1 night ·,Group,April 2022,4 April 2022,,

I addressed this with the restaurant and they admitted being poorly organised.Fed up of waiting we went elsewhere for breakfast despite having already paid at the hotel.

1.0,Day light robbery! Refund please!!!,Location was the only good thing!,I booked this hotel because I ran the London marathon and wanted to use the spa before and after. It was only a week before that I found out the spa was closed. By that stage it was too late to change my booking for elsewhere as London was so booked up by then. The staff were not particularly welcoming and then the key card system for the room didn’t work after the cleaner had been leaving our room open for a whole day! Thankfully nothing was stolen but it left us feeling unsafe. The receptionist then accused us of not having closed the door properly- this was NOT the case. The breakfast was dire and the staff clearly didn’t want to be there. The chef kept disappearing for a cigarette.

5.0,"Amazing location, lacking value","The location of the hotel is honestly amazing. It was literally 2-3 minutes walk at most from everywhere we had planned to go. The room size for a London hotel was decent, however for a suite it is definitely left wanting. Standard check out time was later than normal check out times which was a bonus. The bed was very comfortable, and TV was located in a good position. (You’d be surprised how rare this can be for London Hotels).The Prosecco provided to the room was a nice touch considering this was booked for my partners birthday. Very much appreciated.Staff were friendly and welcoming. They were very accommodating in letting us leave our bags after checkout so we could go and grab some lunch in town!","Enquired about late check out but was told that they could only provide an extra 30 minutes. Not the end of the world, as mentioned in pro’s the standard check out time was late enough anyway and staff were happy to keep check of our bags for us.Considering the price paid for the room, I would have expected far greater attention to detail especially in upkeep and cleanliness of the room.Despite being advertised as a ‘suite’ it was remarkably small. Our room was an adjoining room which we thought was odd for a suite. This meant that sound from next door travelled far more than we would have liked. Easily being able to hear the adjacent room’s tv and the couple next door talking.The bathroom was no bigger than your average hotel bathroom. In fact, it could also arguably considered small. Definitely not what I was expecting when I booked a suite. No bath either which was a shame but unsurprising considering the size of the bathroom.The sink, toilet and shower all cramped into one box room. Some of the towels provided, had small stains and what we can only assume were either the previous guest, or cleaning staff’s hair in them.There were marks, stains and scuffs on the walls.3/4’s of the bulbs in the four poster bed’s star ceiling weren’t functioning. We just turned it off anyway as it was making a loud whirring sound when turned on.The most disappointing thing however, was a collection of ‘interesting’ stains on the curtains of the four poster bed. Again, considering the premium paid for the four poster suite, the minimum I would’ve expected was that the four poster bed itself at least had decent upkeep.",United Kingdom,Four-Poster Suite,1 night ·,Couple,September 2021,11 September 2021,,

He claimed to be the manager and when I went to enter my PIN number in the card machine he said you don’t need to cover your pin as he would already have all my card details from the payment as I paid by card. What a plum. He wanted me to not cover? I didn’t understand his joke if thats what he intended. I found him extremely patronising and rude. Not what you want when you’re checking in to a hotel. Customer service zero. The main manager who we spoke to the next day was very kind and understanding.,United Kingdom,Premier Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,August 2021,17 August 2021,,

You can also buy breakfast for money additionally, but even the food they had available as continental was great.The floors in the bathroom could be heated. The room had everything I needed and was clean.Every time I went to take a taxi the staff would take care after me until I am in the car. Viachealav was very helpful. The staff constantly asked feedback and gave me water. I felt very well taken care of. Also they have good tea. The check in and check out were quick and easy.","Just a couple things - one morning the staff started running knocking on the doors and shouting housekeeping at 8 am in the morning when I decided to sleep in.- I feel like the staff is a little too pushy trying to get a feedback from guests, I was asked to leave a comment a number or times. There’s nothing wrong with that but it is best to do it once or twice maximum otherwise feels like pushing  - small size of the room, but it was my choice - next time will take a big one :)",Belarus,Premier Single Room,3 nights ·,Solo traveller,November 2019,22 November 2019,,

6.0,Great value - but definitely not 5 stars,"The location is second to none- right on Shaftsbury Avenue, moments from Picadilly Circus, Rgents Street, Covent Garden etc - fabulous! We were offered a glass of prosecco unpon arrival and as we were very early the hotel stored our bags for us so we could head out straight away. The continental breakfast was fine and included smoked salmon, fresh breads, fuit and cereals - other options were available at additonal cost. There's a spa of sorts (steam room, jacuzzi etc) but we didn't use those facilities.","We asked for a quiet room but we were overlooking Shaftsbury Avenue which is very noisy. The bed was a very small double and the room was too hot and we couldn't find a way to turn down the heating so we had to open a window which added to the noise. Our room also had a wet room rather than a bathroom and there was no shower screen - so the toilet got soaked every time you had a shower. There were also no shelves in the wet room to put soap bags, and when we were getting ready to go out we had to put our shoes on to go back into the wet room to keep our feet dry. I also found there was no good lighting around any mirrors so again, when I was getting ready to go out, I had to struggle balancing my make up bag in a soaking wet wet room. This could be easily fixed with a couple of shelves and a shower screen in the wet room - or better lighting in the bedroom. I also found parts of the hotel a little shabby - so whilst it was a great value stay in the centre of London, it's definitely not a 5 star hotel.",United Kingdom,Premier Double Room,2 nights ·,Couple,November 2019,19 November 2019,,

Couldn’t open the Windows because of the noise outside, understandable as it is central London but all the more reason for the air con to work!  The shower had a lot of hairs in it (not ours!)  The shower plug hole didn’t have a cover and showed how dirty it was.  The vanity light was broken too, it wouldn’t turn off!  The Bar/Restaurant area left a lot to be desired for a so called 5 Star Hotel. Although we’d paid for breakfast, we decided not to eat there!

It was severely disappointing - aircon/heating failed to work and no access to windows for air which added on being dirty also and frayed tired curtains. It also looked very dated and chipped furniture, huge break in the mirrored wardrobe, both phone and coffee machine not even plugged in or working fully - no instructions  card regarding facilities room service assistance etc. Controls for bath/shower also difficult to understand which one does which as three options. I even slipped and badly bruised getting into shower . Lights to poster bed not working and curtains also tired around. Rang concierge regarding an alternative fan and that a/c not working no resolve or phone back or attendant arrived ultimately left very uncomfortable night sleep and stay as room just too hot.Breakfast was also disappointing - kitchen staff and bar staff disagreement, poor service form the waiter and disorganised, ordered food specified details of items on breakfast, there was again no menu etc to have any option. Felt we were an inconvenience for arriving to breakfast and no one informed that would have to que and wait to go into breakfast. Sat over looking prep area and bar which wasn't clean, disappointing whilst your waiting for breakfast and certainly wouldn't of been worth the additional breakfast charge if we would of had to pay.

We arrived and out room went ready (not their fault we arrived early). They explained that they knew it was a birthday surprise and so they had something planned nice for our room. However when we were shown to our room there was nothing special about it...intact it was just a room like any other.Anyway we didn't want to make a big deal out of it so proceeded to get ready for the activities we had planned. Half way through getting ready (we were in out robes) there was a knock on the door and a member of staff asked if we could go for a walk whilst they did something nice in the room. We advised we were in our robes but would be leaving soon  for our afternoon ahead and asked if she could come back once we had left.Our day was amazing and later on we arrived back at the hotel tired and ready for bed.Sometime during the night we were woke up.ny this awful buzzing noise. We rang down to reception several times but no answer. Eventually my mum went down stairs to find a member of staff who came upstairs and said it was the faulty fridge. He unplugged it but the buzzing continued. It was loud and so annoying but he said there was nothing else he could do. By 4am we still hadn't had any sleep and once again my mum went down to reception and advised we could not sleep in that room. He advised there was  nothing we could do. My mum sat down there for over half an hour arguing whilst several members of staff tried to locate the awful noise. They were rude and said it was tough they couldn't do anything. My mum was in tears as it was a special occasion for us both. Finally we were told after an hour that we could.mobe into a room that had not been cleaned and we were allowed to sleep in there.

3.0,"Not the hotel we booked, very, very disappointed.",The hotel room was very clean and tidy.Pleasant cleaner.Reception staff and Porter polite and helpful,"Our biggest problem is that you sent us an email at 06.30 on the morning of our travel to tell us we were no longer staying at The Piccadilly but were now going to be staying at the Montcalm, Marble Arch.  We were not given any choice and at that time, it was difficult to start looking at other hotels anyway as we were starting our journey.  Whilst we understand there is a pandemic,, we are certain that you were aware that the hotel was closed before 06.30 on the morning of our travel.  The reason we chose The Piccadilly was because it was the ideal place to stay for the places we wanted to visit and the restaurants we had booked, therefore, staying at The Montcalm was very inconvenient to us.We did not feel the Montcalm was of a 5* standard.  The room we were given was very standard considering we had been forced to move to another hotel.  The breakfast was buffet style, which we were very concerned about.  We have visited other hotels recently and been told it was only table service due to the pandemic so to see people handling produce, cutlery and plates was quite alarming given the increase in infections currently.  The staff were reasonably quick in bringing tea and coffee to the table but if you required anything else, it took time to not only get their attention but to actually have the item brought to the table.The food was also of a disappointing standard and felt like the cheapest version of everything had been purchased.  Nothing tasted nice.  Bacon was not cooked properly and was soggy, sausages tasteless, eggs looked unappetising and watery.We used the hotel bar one night.  The barman had no Bailey's due to ""a large party the night before""!! and no nuts or crisps which we felt should be pretty standard and complimentary for a so called 5* hotel.Coffee was good.Fruit bowl was good.",United Kingdom,Premier Double Room,3 nights ·,Couple,June 2021,7 June 2021,,

I had to ring reception as there was only one cup and glass, as if the room was set up for one and not two. It was supposed to be a premier double but was disappointing. Breakfast was horrible. I hate to waste food but had to leave half of the cooked breakfast and looking around, so did everyone else in the dining room. There was also an electric cable trailing right across the floor in the buffet area which was dangerous. I don't know what star rating this hotel is but it was not great.",United Kingdom,,1 night ·,Group,October 2021,4 October 2021,,
