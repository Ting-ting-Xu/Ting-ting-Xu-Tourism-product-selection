A shoutout to Nikka, Ashley, Vadim, Maria, &amp; Ainar who always greeted us with genuine smiles and truly made us feel at home. The setting was lovely and we appreciated the spacious rooms and bathrooms (the family room was perfect for an elderly couple during a five-night stay, and my double room overlooking Marylebone Station was just lovely). The hotel was an oasis of tranquility after a day out and about and all the food we ate there was tasty and convenient (breakfast in the atrium, light lunches on the mezzanine terrace, and a late dinner in the bar).  Pricey, of course, but we left satisfied at this special treat.","None of these points were show-stoppers but addressing them would make any stay here a perfect experience: there aren't any outlets next to the beds; there is only instant coffee &amp; a tea kettle, whereas other hotels of this caliber usually offer nespresso machines, too; the family room didn't have towel racks in the bathroom, which was inconvenient when bathing/showering, and there was only one light switch for such a large bathroom.  On a separate note, a few times the front desk seemed short-staffed, despite several large events that were happening during our stay.

I said I did request on booking.com and I was not aware there's a family package, and she insisted that booking.com would not pass the message therefore there's nothing she could do to help, offered no solution. She was polite but unhelpful in a way that made the checkin process quite unpleasant and made kids feeling disappointed as soon as we arrived. However when we went into the room, the tent was all set up and lovely, so the booking.com message did go through and the hotel tried their best to accommodate, so it was a happy ending.

8.0,A hotel with great atmosphere and service in an excellent location.,"The gentleman who brought our bags to the room and settled us in was excellent, had the most charming manner, was helpful and his customer service was above and beyond (I wish I could remember his name in order to commend him to the management). Service at breakfast was very pleasant and the door staff and reception staff were courteous. The hotel was clean and nicely maintained, as it was during our last visit over 10 years ago. We stayed in a family room and it was a very generous size and well appointed. IF you have a lot of luggage or want space to relax then it is definitely worth booking this size of room.We noted that the bar downstairs also stocked a much better selection of spirits than during our last visit, so that was very welcome.","We found it disappointing that certain useful items that we would have expected to be in the room - i.e. enough glasses/mugs for the three of us (2 adults and a child) and also small plate and basic cutlery would have been useful. We needed to chop some fruit as a snack for our child and were told that there would be a 5GBP charge to bring a plate and cutlery to the room. In the end the charge was waived, however we found it quite ungenerous not to provide such basic amenities in the first place. We found the price point for breakfast quite high because we only wished to have a light breakfast - it really is only worth it  if you want to have a large breakfast and take advantage of the buffet.

Upgraded us as it was our first anniversary, felt special and gave us champagne in our room and rose petals on bed.","I would have liked if the steam room was a bit hotter, and it was a shame there wasn’t a sauna. The pool area was slightly dull compared to the rest of the property, I felt it could have been more “luxury”. The pool and area in general smelt like fuel for some reason also. That was off-putting, I feel lighting and smell are really important parts of rooms &amp; experiences. The pool area definitely lacked the special feel that the rest off the hotel had.  Also, a “deposit” was taken on my husbands card, the cost of the hotel and damage deposit on arrival, I then actually payed when we left with my card. We were quite disappointed that we had to chase up that deposit refund for 5 weeks after our stay. We waiting 3/4 weeks for it to settle on its own, then had to make multiple calls to get it sorted.

You almost feel like a guest in a huge mansion which is a surreal but nice feeling. The rooms are spacious and beautiful, amazing bathroom with amenities you need.","Was it good value for money? Well, it’s a league above many hotels in terms of the quality of the room but I think the price for a simple soft drink is disgraceful and should be evaluated as should the cost of breakfast . Why for example is it a case of an expensive breakfast or nothing . Why does it not have a complimentary continental considering the cost of the room? I get why they keep out the public with their prices but surely guests deserve loyalty with simple things. It’s because of this I chose not to dine in their restaurant. Interestingly I booked it because of the inner decor but didn’t use it. It also looked like many unhappy guests were waiting in line for breakfast too. Lastly , the mobile room keys. They didn’t work for us and we were locked out and had to go to reception! I kept trying to follow the advice to get these to work as did my husband .

If you must insist on this ridiculous rule, then at least offer hats at cost price, rather than making a 400% profit.

We had literally stayed before in the Ritz and it was so uncomfortably “old style”, to the point that even furniture was unfunctional, bed lumpy and floors not even and quiet under the carpet. Everything was screaming “it’s poorly renovated old house!”. The Landmark furniture was functional and although it has much more contemporary style, it wasn’t mentally tiring to be in their room, unlike in the Ritz. Comfortable bed, nice room darkening curtains, big bathroom, good breakfast (better than Ritz, by the way) and quite lovely interior for the whole house. Open atrium was very pleasant. Didn’t try the in-house restaurant or the pub.","We booked a big 50m2 room with a couch, bath and a extra space. Cost about 500€/night. What we originally got was a quite small corner room on the top floor, mostly slanted ceilings, two tiny windows, no couch, no bath and smelled of cigarette smoke. When I called and said this was not quite the room we booked, I got originally a very snippy reply the we got exactly the room we paid for. When i disagreed, they eventually transfered us to the other room. That one was very lovely, exactly as promised with all the necessary additions. But it was truly weird that they tried to pawn off first clearly an inferior room, I would not have expected that from a hotel of such level. Next time I have to not pay up front and argue on the place, but pay at the reception after viewing the room.

Yes, the facilities are nice the pool, the winter garden and food lovely but location wasn't ideal for us with a young child. Second, staff was polite but never felt ""warm"" I never saw a manager around or someone to to talk to me during my stay.

It is in a great location with the tube and rail across the road from the hotel and a 15 minute walk to Oxford Street. Staff are friendly and helpful.,"Unfortunately the room was really noisy. We were in a room that looked over the atrium, which was beautiful but the noise travelled up into the room, especially the piano. The hotel is also popular with weddings on the weekends and the loud music from the reception could be heard in our room until 12:50pm at night.

Shubam from the breakfast lounge. he is rude, arrogant and Lacks any basic service awareness. (the breakfast lounge was almost empty, but he decided to keep us waiting for almost 10 minutes for our table at the entrance, and when asked why, he was very rude and aggressive about it). unfortunately he is not alone (although he was definitely the worst) Tatyana from the bar was unwelcoming as we arrived for a night drink at 12:30 (the bar closes in 1:00). unfortunately the general feeling that you get from most of the staff is that they do you a favour, and definitely not welcoming. this comes as a surprise especially after it’s the only hotel I have ever stayed in that charges you IN ADVANCE 5% EXTRA AS A TIP FOR THE SERVICE….",Israel,Executive Double Room,3 nights ·,Solo traveller,August 2022,29 September 2022,,

5.0,Not worth the price,The main entrance and gardens are very beautiful and are a WOW factor for this hotel. It is a very grand and impressive hotel lobby and restaurant.,"I think for the price I paid (£1200+ for 1 night for 2 rooms) this hotel just didn’t hit the mark for me personally. I found the bed extremely hard/ firm, I didn’t like as you entered the room it had a strong scent of polish and cleaning products, I wasn’t keen on the room decor itself it seemed pretty dated and lacked wow factor like the rest of the hotel. It was very loud at night even being on the 6th floor I felt like my windows were open at one point the street noise was so loud. Our “view” wasn’t a view it was a building site / scaffolding and a half torn down building, other windows were too small to really see anything else out of. The cot they provided was old wooden with tatty cushion bumpers on it and not suitable for my 5 month old, I didn’t use it in the end. The sky didn’t work on my TV it kept stating signal lost after a while I just gave up with it. The bath plug didn’t work or shall I say it was just stuck in the bath so after all our showers there was a small bath that I couldn’t drain. At check in it was very slow and even when there was 3 people on the desk two people were dealing with one family instead of each taking on a new person for check in. My receptionist was nice and informative but struggled with her English. As a family we had a buggy and small children the little steps everywhere was a pain with the buggy, barely any slopes for wheelchair accessibility or pushchairs you would hit at lest 2 steps during your walk from one lobby to the restaurant / exit. We arrived at 2pm and wanted something to eat the receptionist explained they were most likely full and will need to wait and see if the severs could fit us in which was a let down as we didn’t want to be waiting around to try get “squeezed in” we just wanted to be able to eat in the hotel no problems. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel, I would visit to eat here or explore more the spa and enjoy a day visit but I wouldn’t recommend it for a overnight.",United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,1 night ·,Family,August 2022,7 August 2022,,

If it wasn't for this I would have rated the hotel an 8 or even a 9 but this is such an important feature of a hotel I am dumb struck at how hard it was (I actually thought they might have accidentally use a box spring instead of a mattress).

They’ve charged me twice for the booking despite me saying I already paid online during check out and showing them this on my online banking, they assured me the money would go back into my account from the pre approval. Checked my account and they’ve taken another £600. I don’t think the receptionist could understand what I was saying as there was a bit of a language barrier.

The minibar wasn’t stocked.  You had to call for drinks and snacks.  Why?3. The iron in the room was broken and leaking.  4.

I then called down to reception from my mobile phone, I explained what had happened, she then apologised (again) and put me through to room service, room service then told me I needed a different department so put me through to someone else, finally got through to someone who may be able to help.. then they said you cannot order on your mobile phone!? and told me to put the phone down and call back on the landline in the room. by this time it was a bit of a joke and laughable situation.long story short eventually after approx 2 hours after arrival we had a bottle of champagne.the next day upon checkout I explained what had happened, the champagne was taken off the bill.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,September 2022,3 September 2022,,

We waited an additional hour after the 3pm standard time.The floor staff in the restaurant refused to allow us to move a chair to accommodate our party so that we could wait for our delayed check in.This delay caused us to miss our pre-booked restaurant reservations, we were now extremely hungry and refused somewhere to sit.The bar staff also allowed another guest to be extremely rude to a member of our party when we returned to the bar having been for dinner.The hotel is over priced and does not compare to the service levels of the Ritz of Dorchester where we had been that evening. If you are short staffed operate at a reduced capacity as it seriously did put our trip off to a bad start. I certainly wouldn’t recommend this hotel to our friends. There were four seperate rooms taken for two nights in our party, so quite a large booking for our annual Christmas trip.Our collective hotel bill was well over £5000 so quite large in my opinion for five friends for two nights, so to be shunned by the management did leave a bad taste; we asked for a resolution once we checked out; but are yet to hear anything back; this again shows how poor the service is as it could have been dealt with whilst we were in the building.

Our hotel room though large was somewhat frumpy in decor. There was also a strange smell (not unpleasant per se...just strange) If I didn't know better I would say it was a faint aroma of stale cigarette smoke but given how long it has been since smoking was acceptable in hotels it was probably some sort of carpet cleaner. The mirror bar was ok but nothing special for this level of hotel.  Overall the hotel seemed a little faded and a touch old fashioned - More of a decent 4* than a 5* IMHO. Bearing in mind we paid well over £400 for the night it didn't quite hit the mark.,United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,September 2021,29 September 2021,,

2.0,Very disappointed!,,"We arrived a little before check in time at 1pm and were told our room wasn't ready yet but was put on a priority list and they'd let us know when it was ready so we happily left our bags and went out for a few hours. At 4pm we still hadn't been contacted so we headed back to see if our room was ready. When we arrived at the reception desk at 4.30pm we were told our room still wasn't ready because the hotel had been exceptionally busy that weekend. I was extremely upset because it was our 2 years wedding anniversary and we had dinner booked for 5.30, when I spoke to the manager he was very dismissive of the issue and told me if I needed somewhere to get ready he could provide me a changing room.I think when your paying £350 pound for a room this is totally unacceptable. We finally got the key to our room at 5.30pm so we missed our dinner. I've been wanting to stay at this hotel for a long time and after the experience I received I will most definitely not be going back nor will I recommend it to anyone.",United Kingdom,Deluxe Double Room,1 night ·,Couple,August 2021,5 September 2021,,

Overall room was good.The front desk was also very helpful and polite.","I believe for a 5* hotel, there should have been more effort made in the bathroom, it felt quite dated, the shower head leaked and had no power to it, the bidet also leaked all around the toilet area. Not sure what the policy is with soaps/toiletries,shower gel etc, but there was only 3 bottle's, we kept asking for more and the quality of the brand used wasn't particularly great, example shampoo dried my hair out... Not nice!!.  Overall the room had a musky smokey smell, as though it used to be a smoking room then changed to non-smoking.

The hotel is very handy for a quick pop (walk or taxi) to Selfridges/Mayfair.","Spending a few days there, being forced to leave by one entrance (front) and exit by another (at the rear) became quite tiresome. Especially, if you’d just popped out to the shops with bags or had forgotten something from your room. Whereas doormen previously welcomed you to the hotel, they now act more like club bouncers. Needs a review I’d suggest. The waiter at the Garden Restaurant was poorly trained and could barely understand English, which made for a stressful meal as one dish didn’t turn up and side dishes went astray. He tried to blame this on us for not ordering, even though two people had confirmed the order. So our 9 year old had to wait for her burger, while our food went cold.

The bedding didn’t smell fresh, it smelt like grease. Ordered breakfast to my room. Wanted toast, got soggy bread. It was also cold. I had waited almost an hour for it to turn up cold.

The following day i did speak to the reception manager who changed a room for me. Again two queen beds, but an extra bed was provided. The new room facing the winter garden was better and certainly quieter. However, on non of the 4 nights was turndown service provided; on one of the days the room was not even serviced at all.

I had requested a quiet room since pregnant, I got a room on a floor where they had rented a suite out for a pvt party, music was blaring and people were coming in and out. all in - did not care about the email I got while booking, changed the policy on arrival, made me wait 45mins at 9pm at night to get me a room and manager never got in touch. very unfriendly service and they are cheats if they change the policy and rules on arrival.",United Kingdom,,2 nights ·,Solo traveller,June 2022,10 July 2022,,
